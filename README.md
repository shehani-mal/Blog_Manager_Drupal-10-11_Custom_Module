# Blog Manager â€“ Custom Drupal Blog Module

**Blog Manager** is a fully functional Drupal custom module that extends the default blog features provided by Drupal 9 and 10 core. While Drupal core includes a basic Blog content type, this module provides enhanced functionality tailored for real-world editorial workflows.

## ðŸ†š How This Module Enhances the Core Blog

Drupal 9 and 10 include the "Blog" content type in the standard installation profile, but it is limited in scope. Blog Manager upgrades this by introducing:

- **Custom editorial workflow statuses**: Draft, Ready to Publish, Published, Rejected, Archived
- **Role-based editorial access and permissions**

  - Title
  - Banner Image (JPG, PNG, GIF under 5MB)
