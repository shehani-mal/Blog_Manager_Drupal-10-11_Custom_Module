# Blog Manager â€“ Custom Drupal Blog Module

**Blog Manager** is a fully functional Drupal custom module that extends the default blog features provided by Drupal 9 and 10 core. While Drupal core includes a basic Blog content type, this module provides enhanced functionality tailored for real-world editorial workflows.
